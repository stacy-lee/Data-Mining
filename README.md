# Projects from Data Warehousing & Data Mining Course
These are programming assignments I submitted for the data mining course I took at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
## Implementing the Random Forest From Scratch
I wrote out the random forest algorithm using the decision tree code that I wrote from scratch. My code is capable of running within 3 minutes for the datasets we were given to test on, where the maximum allowable time was 5 minutes. 

## Frequent Pattern Mining using the Apriori Algorithm
This objective of this project was to perform frequent itemset mining and output the outlier resilient item sets into a text file in sorted order.
